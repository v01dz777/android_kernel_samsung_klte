Please note:<br>
CM13 is <u><b>still</b></u> not 100% stable, so please "happily" expect some crashes and 
reboots. This will get better step by step over the time as CM13 is currently under 
heavy development.<br><br>

Side note:<br>
Interactive CPU governor is by far the most stable governor on this device, so you might 
consider using it when your main goal is highest stability.
